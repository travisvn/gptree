## What is gptree?

When working with Large Language Models (LLMs) to continue or debug your coding projects, providing the right context is key. `gptree` simplifies this by:

1. Generating a clear **directory tree structure** of your project.
2. Combining the **contents of relevant files** into a single output text file.
3. Allowing you to **select files interactively** to fine-tune which files are included.

The resulting file can easily be copied and pasted into LLM prompts to provide the model with the necessary context to assist you effectively.

## Features

- 🗂 **Tree Structure**: Includes a visual directory tree of your project.
- ✅ **Smart File Selection**: Automatically excludes ignored files using `.gitignore` and common directories like `.git`, `__pycache__`, and `.vscode`.
- 🎛 **Interactive Mode**: Select or deselect files interactively using arrow keys, with the ability to quit immediately by pressing `ESC`.
- 🌍 **Global Config Support**: Define default settings in a `~/.gptreerc` file.
- 🔧 **Directory-Specific Config**: Customize behavior for each project via a `.gptree_config` file.
- 🎛 **CLI Overrides**: Fine-tune settings directly in the CLI for maximum control.
- 📜 **Safe Mode**: Prevent overly large files from being combined by limiting file count and total size.
- 📋 **Clipboard Support**: Automatically copy output to clipboard if desired.
- 🛠 **Custom Configuration Management**: Define configurations that are auto-detected per project or globally.

## Installation

### Install via `pipx` 📦 (Recommended)
```bash
pipx install gptree-cli
```

[How to setup pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/)

### Install via Homebrew 🍺
```bash
brew tap travisvn/tap
brew install gptree
```

Homebrew will attempt to install `gptree` using `pip3` and will fall back to binary installation otherwise

### Install via pip 🐍
Alternatively, install `gptree` (`gptree-cli`) directly via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/gptree-cli/):
```bash
pip install gptree-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> Performance is better when installing directly with Python (`pipx` or `pip`)
>
> The binary installation might take a second or two longer to start up (not a huge deal — just something to note)

## Usage

Run `gptree` in your project directory:

```bash
gptree
```

Or run it anywhere and define the relative path to your project

| `--exclude-file-types`      | Comma-separated list of file types to exclude (e.g., `.log,.tmp` or `log,tmp`) |
| `--output-file`             | Specify the name of the output file                                        |
| `--output-file-locally`     | Save the output file in the current working directory                      |
| `--no-config`, `-nc`        | Disable creation or use of configuration files                             |

| `path`                      | (Optional) Root directory of your project. Defaults to `.`                 |

### Examples

Interactive file selection with custom file types:
```bash
gptree --interactive --include-file-types '.py,.js'
```

Save current selection to config:
```bash
gptree --interactive --save
```

Re-use previously saved file selections and copy to clipboard:
```bash
gptree --previous --copy
```

## Configuration

### Global Config (`~/.gptreerc`)

Define your global defaults in `~/.gptreerc` to avoid repetitive setup across projects. Example:

```yaml
# ~/.gptreerc
version: 1
useGitIgnore: true
includeFileTypes: .py,.js  # Include only Python and JavaScript files
excludeFileTypes: .log,.tmp  # Exclude log and temporary files
outputFile: gptree_output.txt
outputFileLocally: true
copyToClipboard: false
safeMode: true
lineNumbers: false
storeFilesChosen: true
```

This file is automatically created with default settings if it doesn't exist.

### Directory Config (`.gptree_config`)

Customize settings for a specific project by adding a `.gptree_config` file to your project root. Example:

```yaml
# .gptree_config
version: 1
useGitIgnore: false
includeFileTypes: *  # Include all file types
excludeFileTypes: .test  # Exclude test files
outputFile: gptree_output.txt
outputFileLocally: false
copyToClipboard: true
safeMode: false
lineNumbers: false
storeFilesChosen: false
```

### Configuration Precedence

Settings are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):
1. **CLI Arguments**: Always override other settings.
2. **Global Config**: User-defined defaults in `~/.gptreerc`.
3. **Directory Config**: Project-specific settings in `.gptree_config`.
4. **Programmed Defaults**: Built-in defaults used if no other settings are provided.

## Safe Mode

To prevent overly large files from being combined, Safe Mode restricts:
- The **total number of files** (default: 30).
- The **combined file size** (default: ~25k tokens, ~100,000 bytes).

Override Safe Mode with `--disable-safe-mode`.

## Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, use the following controls:

| Key         | Action                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| `↑/↓`       | Navigate the file list              |
| `SPACE`     | Toggle selection of the current file |
| `a`         | Select or deselect all files        |
| `ENTER`     | Confirm the selection and proceed   |
| `ESC`       | Quit the process immediately        |
